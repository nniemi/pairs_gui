## Pairs_GUI
This program is a basic memory game, which asks the user to input card amount, seed value and amount of players. After this the player can press "Confirm" which allows the player to input player names. After submitting player names, the program will form a game board which consists the card amount which the player submitted.

After the game board has been formed, the player can choose which card to turn by clicking on the card. Once the player chooses a card, program checks if it is the first or second card chosen. If it is the second one of a pair, program checks if they form a correct pair. If so, the player gains a pair and gets to choose a new card. Once the player guesses wrong, next player gets a turn.

Once all cards has been turned, program prints a message to show who won and how many pairs the winner had. If there happens to be a tie, the game will inform how many players had a tie and how many pairs they had.

Player can close the program using close button at any time.

*A simple example of the game being played*

This program is basically the same game as pairs in my repository, but it uses GUI to play instead of ASCII code. This makes it very QT Creator heavy, since it uses many features from QT library. This project scored 84/100 on our grading scale, partly due to tight schehdule and inexperience from QT graphic designing.
